# REQUIREMENTS

Develop a web app that encourages and engages employees, regardless of location or culture Provide features to allow employees to appreciate and recognize their peers, share achievements, and celebrate special occasions. Offer a powerful rewards engine for recognizing employee achievements, providing gift cards, merchandise, and other incentives. Use node.js and PostgreSQL for backend development. Use React for web app development. Provide analytics to measure the effectiveness of the program and employee engagement. Ensure the app is user-friendly and easy to navigate

# SOLUTIONS

Our team developed Peoppl using React for the frontend and node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend. We designed the app to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a simple and intuitive interface. To encourage employee engagement, we created a social wall that allows employees to share their achievements and see what their peers are accomplishing. The social wall helps employees to spread positivity and motivation, regardless of location or culture. For special occasions, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and years of service, Peoppl automatically sends ecards to employees, along with customizable awards, badges, and certificates. To recognize employee achievements, we developed a powerful rewards engine that provides gift cards, merchandise, and experiences. This helps to incentivize employees and recognize their hard work and dedication. We also provided analytics to measure the effectiveness of the program and employee engagement. This helps employers to understand what works best and how engaged their employees are.

The app has helped to increase employee engagement, with many reporting increased motivation and positivity. The social wall has proven to be effective in encouraging employees to share their achievements and recognize the accomplishments of their peers.
